## 🎯 Specific Checks for NextMap

### Linux Build Issues (Expected)
- **OpenSSL cross-compilation**: Known issue from Windows
- **Missing system packages**: Normal on GitHub runners
- **Solution**: GitHub runners have proper Linux environment

### Windows Build Issues
- **7z not found**: Should be available on windows-latest
- **Path separators**: Using `\` vs `/`

### macOS Build Issues  
- **Target not added**: aarch64-apple-darwin might need setup
- **Xcode dependencies**: Should be pre-installed

### Release Step Issues
- **File patterns**: `**/*.zip` and `**/*.tar.gz` should work
- **Artifact names**: Must match between upload and download

## 🔧 Debugging Steps

1. **Check individual job logs** in the Actions tab
2. **Look for red X marks** on specific jobs
3. **Expand failed steps** to see error details
4. **Common fix patterns**:
   - Add missing dependencies
   - Fix file paths
   - Update action versions
   - Add environment variables

## 📊 Quick Diagnosis Commands

```bash
# Check if artifacts were created
ls -la artifacts/
ls -la **/*.zip **/*.tar.gz

# Verify build outputs
ls -la target/*/release/

# Check workflow syntax
yamllint .github/workflows/release.yml
```

## 🚀 Next Actions

Based on error type:
1. **Build errors**: Fix dependencies or compilation
2. **Archive errors**: Fix paths and commands  
3. **Upload errors**: Check artifact configuration
4. **Release errors**: Verify download and file patterns
