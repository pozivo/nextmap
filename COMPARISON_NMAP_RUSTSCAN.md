## 💡 Hybrid Approach Strategy

### Best Practice: Combine Tools

```bash
# Step 1: Fast enumeration with RustScan
rustscan -a target.com --top -b 10000 > open_ports.txt

# Step 2: Detailed scan with NextMap (balanced)
nextmap target.com --ports $(cat open_ports.txt) -s -O -o json

# Step 3: Deep vulnerability scan with Nmap (when needed)
nmap -sV -sC -p $(cat open_ports.txt) target.com -oX detailed.xml
```

**Rationale**:
1. RustScan finds ports in seconds
2. NextMap provides fast service/OS detection
3. Nmap handles complex vulnerability checks

**Time Saved**: Up to 80% vs nmap-only approach
